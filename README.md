# Twitch-Chat-Plays-Pokemon
It is a node.js app that let's a Twitch.tv chat interact with a video game by typing in the chat 

## How to use it

1. Download visualBoy
2. Dowload your favorite Pokemon Game (This code can work with other GBA games but was tested with Pokemon Fire Red)

3. Dowload Node.js
4. Make sure you have all the needed modules (you can see a list of them in the package.json file).
5. Generate a password to allow your bot to access your Twitch Channel (Official twitch website: http://twitchapps.com/tmi/)
6. add the generated password, your channel name and a bot name of your choice in the appropriate spaces in Index.js
```javascript
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
6. run the Index.js script with Node.js
7. Let your twitch chat do the rest ;)
